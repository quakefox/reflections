How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me quickly locate which line has the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    So that I can quickly revert back or move forward.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    So user have more control of what gets commmitted into the repository.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    For a feature sometimes requires changes in multiple files, so Git supports the dependencies among multiple files. But for Google Doc and others are tailored for single document archiving.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Use git log and git diff <original commit id> <new commit id> to view the history.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control keeps all the history fo changes, there is no lost work.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Try new ideas without worrying about backward compatibility. Manage my own repo.
